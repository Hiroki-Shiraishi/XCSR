There is no problem with the classification accuracy, but there is a problem with the acquired classifiers(As you can see in './result/classifier.csv', in the population set, there are multiple classifiers with the same conditions and actions.). If anyone can help me with this problem, I would appreciate it if you could contact me. Thank you.
