# XCSR (XCS for Real Values)
This is based ENTIRELY on "An algorithmic description of XCS" and "Get Real! XCS with Continuous-Valued Inputs". You can solve N-bit Real Multiplexer problem(default: N = 6).

XCSR supports real values input. The one dedicated to binary input is here: https://github.com/Hiroki-Shiraishi/XCS

```
python main.py
```
If you want to change the hyperparameters, refer to "parameters.py", please.

!CAUTION!

These programs are UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 

There is no problem with the classification accuracy, but there is a problem with the acquired classifiers(As you can see in './result/classifier.csv' after you run these programs, in the population set, there are multiple classifiers with the same conditions and actions without subsumption.). If you find a way to solve this problem, I would appreciate it if you could contact me or create an issue in the repository. Thank you.
